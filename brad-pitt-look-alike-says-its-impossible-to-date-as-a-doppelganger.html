No, it’s actually just a dad from Oxford, England.</p><p>Nathan Meads is a single dad who works as a groundworker but moonlights as a Brad Pitt impersonator.</p><p>Meads, 35, bares an uncanny resemblance to Pitt, 57, and explained to Jam Press how it’s hard to date women who are obsessed with the Oscar winner. The father of two revealed he started working as an impersonator three years ago after many people made multiple comments about his resemblance.</p><p>“I was first told when I was 20 years old that I looked like Brad Pitt and this continued for about 10 years but I would always just laugh it off,” he said.</p><p>“Some people would say I must be related to him or that my mum must have had an affair with him,” he added. “A lot of people, even now, will do a double-take when they walk past me or will ask me for a picture, although some of them just take pictures without me realizing.”</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Nathan Meads<span class=credit>Jam Press/@bradpitt_lookalike</span></figure><p>Meads said it took him years to figure out a way to make his resemblance benefit him.</p><p>“While hundreds of people told me I looked like him, I never did anything about it but then it became a constant thing that, wherever I went, people would say it,” Meads said, adding he sent photos to four different look-alike agencies who were eager to work with him.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Brad Pitt<span class=credit>FilmMagic</span></figure><p>Meads was even contacted by Dorien Rose, the famous Angelina Jolie look-alike who wanted to collaborate with him. He makes anywhere from £250 to £500 (roughly $350 to $690 in US dollars) per look-alike gig.</p><p>But when it comes to dating, Meads admitted it’s quite hard to find love due to his looks.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Meads explained it is hard to date women when he looks like the “Fight Club” star. “I’m not looking for my Angelina,” he said.<span class=credit>Jam Press/@bradpitt_lookalike</span></figure><p>“I do get hit on by women a lot,” he said. “Some of them just can’t believe how much I look like him and some of them accuse me of ‘catfishing.’ People always try and live video call me on my Instagram because they don’t think I’m real.”</p><p>While he has tried dating apps, however, some women accuse him of having fake profiles and others will “literally start stalking” him.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">Meads said women have stalked him before.<span class=credit>Jam Press/@bradpitt_lookalike</span></figure><p>“I just deleted my dating profiles and I’m just staying single,” he said. “I’m not really looking for love anyway and don’t want to settle down as my daughters are my world and my biggest priority. I’m not looking for my Angelina.”</p><p>His doppelgänger status has also scored him some invites to red carpet events where he has met some other famous faces. Before the coronavirus pandemic forced the world to go into lockdown in March 2020, he went to the Glamour Awards in London as well as other fashion events.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">Meads said an Angelina Jolie impersonator has contacted him to work together.<span class=credit>Jam Press/@bradpitt_lookalike</span></figure><p>He then joked about how people are “always so surprised at how humble and down to earth” he is. “I just think we are all the same and I’ve just been blessed with these good looks,” he said.</p><p>While Meads and Pitt have yet to meet face-to-face, the look-alike hopes they will one day. “I am a big Brad Pitt fan and I think he’s a great actor. He plays all of his roles brilliantly and seems like a real gentleman and a family man so we have that in common, although we have very different bank balances,” Meads quipped.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">“I’ve just been blessed with these good looks,” he said.<span class=credit>Jam Press/@bradpitt_lookalike</span></figure><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnkqeupXnPoqutZZykvKx5wKWgpJ1dqK66v4yiq6xlmaK9sL%2FSopmlnV2pvG6wwK2cZpmjYq5usM6pp56kl5a7qLHRaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
