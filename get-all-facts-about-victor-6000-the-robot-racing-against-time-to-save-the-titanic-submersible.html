Victor is able to do visual exploration with all the video equipment it has. It is also equipped with manipulating arms which could be used to extricate the sub, such as by sectioning cables or things that would be blocking it at the bottom.”</p><p>The French submarine Nautile, which was also used by L’Atalante, has been to the Titanic wrecks several times before.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-22-at-22.17.46.png><p>The Victor 6000 also boasts robotic arms that could potentially aid in the search operation. However, a decision regarding their usage has not yet been finalized.</p><p>In the ongoing search operation, aircraft have played a vital role. Notably, a Canadian P-3 aircraft has been instrumental in detecting distinctive “banging” sounds that have garnered significant attention and helped focus the search efforts.</p><p>Lefort mentioned that the US Navy sought assistance from their agency, and they couldn’t refuse due to their personal connection.</p><p>One of the five crew members on the missing submarine, Paul-Henri Nargeolet, is a former employee of their agency, which further motivated their involvement in the search.</p><p>“This is the logic of seafarers. Our attitude was: We are close, we have to go.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-22-at-22.20.45.png><p>According to Andy Coles, a former commanding officer of a submarine, there is a possibility that the passengers of the submarine may have already succumbed to oxygen deprivation, even if they are eventually rescued by the Victor 6000.</p><p>Coles expressed concern that the passengers could have been affected by carbon dioxide poisoning, which can be fatal in enclosed spaces with limited ventilation.</p><p>Additionally, he noted that even if the Victor 6000 successfully locates the vessel, it would still take an estimated two months to bring it to the surface.</p><p>Coles shared his thoughts on the matter during an interview with The Mirror.</p><p>“I don’t think the submarine has any means of cleaning out the CO2 and recirculating the air. So they will probably go to sleep way before they don’t fully suffocate. The other thing to also consider is 3,800 metres down, it’s incredibly cold.</p><p>As of this article’s writing, there has been no update on the lives of the passengers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifKix02aYpaRdm66kwNJmmJunpal6t7XCraarZWZlfXF506GcZqqfl7y1edGamqKml2KuqK3Ip6qtZaSeuqZ506hkrJmmmnq1tMRmq6KskaO2pHnSrpmmnaKotqO4xGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
