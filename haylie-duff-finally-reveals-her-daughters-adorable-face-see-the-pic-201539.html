She hasn’t tried to push her way on me. There have been times where I’ve been physically overwhelmed, and she’ll just come over and hold the baby for an hour. Just physically being there has been the best thing she’s done for me in this process.”</p><p>The sisters are currently teaming up to start a Sister of Motherhood campaign, which they hope will help moms — first time and otherwise — create a supportive community together.</p><p>“No one really understands what being a mom is like until they go through it themselves,” Hilary told Yahoo. “Even watching from the outside, Haylie was always very supportive… So it’s been a really cool time for us to be really good to one another.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ%2BasZyesm6w1J%2BdZp6Zo66tuNhmqZ6ulZa5tHnHnqlmnJGqtKnAxKuqZpmUpL%2BirsueZJ%2BZk5p6tLHEZquhnV2ltqR5kWlobmtp</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
