The images, which appeared on a Tumblr blog,&nbsp;showcased floating headless models, with phrases like "Modern-day Spice Girls," and "Unapologetic, loud and fun," according to <a href=#>HuffPost Style</a>, who viewed the site before it became password-protected.&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<p>"I've been bamboozled with a tumblr page where everyone wears socks and takes unintentional crotch shots on pool toys. I'm in shock," Azalea tweeted (which has since been deleted). "Tainted with these God awful images that Steve madden took appon themselves to create and share without my knowledge," she continued. "Gross gross gross."&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<p>The Australian rapper, 24, and the trendy footwear company first announced their partnership in August 2014. "I worked really hard on the creative direction of both the shoes and the shoot I WAS involved with and in," the star wrote in another deleted tweet. "Everything in a collaboration is supposed to be mutually approved. But Steve madden did the most disgusting photo shoot ever."&nbsp;</p><p>The brand caught wind of her tweets and issued a statement to the <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong>.&nbsp;"This was a lover's quarrel. We love Iggy and are very excited about our collaboration," the company said. "When you get two artists working together sometimes there are fireworks. It's our creative differences that allow us to design an incredible collection and we are looking forward to sharing it with the world!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p>&nbsp;<p>In the aftermath, Azalea clarified the feud in a lengthy post on Instagram on Thursday, Jan. 29. "What I had a 'rant' about on Twitter isn't in regards to these pictures, it was about another, different set of images I wasn't a part of creating that I felt weren't reflective of my vision and direction for the collection," she <a href=#>captioned</a> a collage of the approved promo images. "I'm an artist and I'm extremely passionate and emotional and crazy sometimes because I care ALOoOoot about this sh-t! I love Steve and he gets it!"&nbsp;</p><p>Just a week before on Jan. 21, Azalea shared what the design process was like to <strong>Us</strong>&nbsp;â€” and according to the star, she was very involved. "I think I was so involved I made everybody at Steve Madden want to pull their hair out, " she told <strong>Us</strong>. "I was so excited and I love to sketch, so I kind of sketched a lot the designs and we would go back and forth."</p><p>Are you going to shop the Iggy Azalea for Steve Madden shoe line?
