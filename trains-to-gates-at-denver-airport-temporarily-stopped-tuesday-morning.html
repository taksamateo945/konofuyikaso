They were still being metered after the trains started up again to allow the train platforms to clear.</p><p>Anybody flying out of the A Gates can use the A Bridge security and walk to the A Gates.</p><p>However, DIA does not have a way to walk to any of the other Gates. The airport said it is “exploring other ideas to provide an alternate way to get to B and C” on Tuesday.</p><p>Photos show a tightly packed crowd of people waiting near the trains and stopped security lines.</p><p>In August 2021, <a class=Link href=# rel=noopener>emergency repairs at DIA</a> reduced capacity at the trains and created a 10-hour delay for travelers getting from the terminal to the concourses. After the repairs were complete, the airport said in a statement: “We are committed to exploring options to provide alternate ways to move passengers between the terminal and concourses and improving our process when incidents like this occur.”</p><p>As of now, no alternate ideas have been announced.</p><p><i>This is a developing story and will be updated.</i></p><p>xfbml : true, version : 'v2.9' }); }; (function(d, s, id){ var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;} js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js"; js.async = true; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpKeuqrrSZquoZZeWwaa%2FjJqrZpyVo8OmvoyaoKuon6fBbsDEpqeoqpGntq3FjKyrqKigmrFuwNSeqp2ZqWK6sL7NoqWgZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
