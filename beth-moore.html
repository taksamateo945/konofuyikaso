Notable for establishing a Texas-based evangelical organization known as Living Proof Ministries and a radio program called Living Proof with Beth Moore, this Christian teacher and activist also penned several Bible and religion-themed works, including A Woman’s Heart: God’s Dwelling Place (2007) and When Godly People Do Ungodly Things (2002).</p><p>She and <a href=#>John C. Maxwell</a> both established high-profile careers as Evangelical Christian speakers and writers.</p><p>She married Keith Moore in 1978. They have two grown daughters, Amanda and Melissa. Both daughters, along with son-in-law Curtis Jones, work with their mother at Living Proof Ministries.</p><p>Moore committed her life to vocational Christian ministry at the age of 18. When she was volunteering as a Sunday school teacher, Moore realized she needed to learn more about the Bible. She went to a biblical doctrine class that gave her a deep yearning to know the Bible, and she began sharing her expanding knowledge through a weekly Bible study class. By the mid-1990s that class had grown to 2,000 women, and she was speaking at churches throughout South Texas. Although still without any formal theological education degree, LifeWay Christian Resources’ publishing arm Broadman & Holman (later B&H) began publishing her Bible studies, leading to a national speaking ministry for Moore. With the help of a worship band she assembled, she began holding weekend conferences around the country. As a base for her national speaking ministry, she founded Living Proof Ministries.</p><p align=justify>Born in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and raised in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, she grew up with one younger and three older siblings. Her marriage to Keith Moore began in 1978 and produced daughters named Amanda and Melissa.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Beth Moore</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Beth</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Moore</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Religious Leader</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 16</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1957</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wisconsin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wisconsin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Tony Green</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Keith Moore</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Melissa Moore</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Beth Moore ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
