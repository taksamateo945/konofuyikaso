Since the news broke, the late Emmy winner's on-screen family has publicly spoken about the tragic loss.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kelly Bishop</strong>, who played Richard's wife Emily Gilmore for all seven seasons of the small-town drama, released a statement to <a href=#>TVLine</a> about the loss of her on-screen husband.&nbsp;</p><p>"We, the Gilmore Girls family, are so terribly sad and somewhat stunned," Bishop said in the statement. "We only learned about his illness a week or so ago. I got a call from [Edward’s wife] Star Monday night asking if I wanted to come to the hospital to say good-bye. I went yesterday and was able to give Ed love from Lauren [Graham], Alexis [Bledel] and Amy [Sherman-Palladino]… I have so many fond memories of our time together on Gilmore Girls and since, mainly via email. I think everyone who knew or worked with Ed found him to be absolutely delightful… Everything looks a little dim, as if the lights went down."</p><p>Star <strong>Lauren Graham</strong>, who played Richard's daughter Lorelai Gilmore, <a href=#>tweeted</a>, "My friend Ed Herrmann was the kindest, classiest, most talented man. It was an honor and a joy to know him, a devastating blow to lose him."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Alexis Bledel</strong></a>, who played Richard's granddaughter, also paid tribute to Herrmann.

He was endlessly knowledgeable about theater, TV and film, and would generously share his wisdom or tell stories from a long and rewarding career," she said to <a href=#>TVLine</a>. "I am grateful to him for that, and will miss him tremendously. He loved acting and was the head of our Gilmore family with his strong presence and great sense of humor.
