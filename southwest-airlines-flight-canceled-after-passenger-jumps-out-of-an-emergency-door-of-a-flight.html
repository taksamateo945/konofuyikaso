TikToker Zedweb08 posted the clip of the people panicking.</p><p>“He put something on the plane, and then he jumped out the exit window,” a voice<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> explains</a>, as people push past him and tell others to go. Some passengers are sitting, trying to understand what’s happening, but others, without asking any questions, plow to the exit door near the cockpit.</p><p>The video then shows a frantic Southwest worker instructing people to safety.</p><p>As the man recording walks into the gate area, he says, “I never dreamed I’d be going through something like this,” before noticing authorities detaining the man through an airport window.</p><p>“There he is. They got him. Thank God,” the narrator says while watching the arrest.</p><p>The man jumped out of an over-wing emergency exit located over the plane’s wings, an escape for those who agreed to sit in these exceptionally spacious seats. If this had been an authorized evacuation, as listed in the manual tucked in the back seat net pocket, the passengers would have slid down the wings before reaching the tarmac.</p><p>Southwest Airlines released a statement on the incident.</p><p>“We commend our flight and ground crews for their swift action and apologize to our customers for their inconvenience,” the airline said.</p><p>The JPSO also states that, as of now, there are no criminal charges expected to be filed in their jurisdiction. But the case has been referred to federal authorities, who will review it to see if they will pursue charges against the man.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e5BqZmtwX6i8tsDHsJysrF2WtrO4yKecrGWWobaotNNmmpqmk5q5prCMmp2tnaJivaK%2F0p6loJ2iYre2uc%2BsZKitpGK8p3nAp2SepZWntKa6wrJknaefp3qwsoyaZJ%2BkmZy1tXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
