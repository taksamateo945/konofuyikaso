Viewers are curious to learn more about <a href=#><strong>Chelsea Meissner</strong></a>'s baby's father with the recent news of her pregnancy. So who is her husband? or who is her boyfriend as of 2023?</p><p>Previously, we discussed the <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>relationship status</strong></a> of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Moneysign Suede</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>DJ Akademiks</strong></a>.</p><h2>Chelsea Meissner’s Boyfriend, Her Baby’s Father, Has Not Been Revealed Until 2023; Also, She Is neither Married nor Engaged!</h2><p>Yes, <strong>Chelsea Meissner</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@chelsameissner58</a>) is <a href=# rel=noopener>pregnant</a>. Chelsea recently mentioned a boyfriend in an Instagram post, but she did not identify him. Because of this, online people have asked inquiries like, "Who's the baby daddy?" in the comment sections.</p><p>Following her departure from <a href=# rel=noopener>Southern Charm</a> in 2019, Chelsea Meissner made the pregnancy announcement on Wednesday while keeping the identity of the father a complete secret.

The announcement felt like a full-circle moment in the wake of the passing of her dog, Tyson, in August, Meissner, 37, wrote in the caption. "The circle of life is a powerful thing," she added. Chelsea Meissner said;</p><p><strong>When Tyson passed away, I realized that I could only love another soul nearly as deeply if I had my child; now, here we are with a child on the way. Simply put, you just never know what God has in store for you.</strong></p><p>Despite not confirming the gender of her child in the post's text, Meissner may have implied that she is having a girl by using the song "My Little Girl" by <strong>Jack Johnson</strong> as the video's background music. She also made fun of the fact that the child's father was a new acquaintance. So she confirmed that as of 2023, she has a new boyfriend. The TV personality wrote, "</p><p><strong>Here's to a thick girl summer! I'm so fortunate to have strong women in my life who have prepared the way for me to become a mother, and I'm lucky to have one hell of a man!</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/04/chelsea-meissner-boyfriend-austen.jpg alt="Chelsea Meissner dated her ex-boyfriend, Austen Kroll." width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Chelsea Meissner dated her ex-boyfriend, Austen Kroll.<br></strong><strong>Source: Bravo TV</strong></p><p>Chelsea Meissner hasn't revealed her boyfriend but was previously in a relationship; she debuted as a guest star on the reality show in season 3, returned the following year as a recurring cast member, and then was promoted to a full-time cast member for seasons 5 and 6. She dated <strong>Austen Kroll</strong> for a short time throughout her three seasons on Southern Charm before deciding to keep her personal life private. She is open about what she's doing in Charleston these days, but she keeps her love life a secret.</p><p>The last time Chelsea Meissner shared a photo of Nick, it was of his legs in January 2020. She hasn't made any clear comments about her relationship status on her Instagram page, but it doesn't seem like they are still dating. She doesn't subscribe to Nick's app. Meissner's former co-stars from Southern Charm left encouraging comments on her post, including Cameran <strong>Eubanks</strong>, who had her daughter <strong>Palmer Corrine</strong> as her first child in November 2017. The 39-year-old Eubanks commented;</p><p><strong>P can't wait for her Podna to arrive! I LOVE HER ALREADY!</strong></p><p>Naomie Olindo added,</p><p><strong>I couldn't be more excited for you, my Chels, Congratulations! You're going to be a great mom!"</strong></p><p>The cast members of Chelsea's Southern Charm wished her well in addition to her admirers. <strong>Naomi Olindo</strong> expressed how happy she was, and <strong>Madison LeCroy</strong> complimented her and called her a wonderful mother. One of the cast members of Southern Charm who was most beloved by the audience was Chelsea Meissner; however, she left in May 2020. <strong>Shep Rose</strong> and Austen Kroll were drawn to her when she joined the cast. After picking Austen, Chelsea put an end to the love triangle drama, but their relationship was short-lived because they found they had different priorities in life.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/04/chelsea-meissner-husband.jpg alt="Chelsea Meissner doesn't have a husband." width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Chelsea Meissner has not revealed her boyfriend and doesn't have a husband.<br></strong><strong>Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>Although fans wonder if Chelsea Meissner is married and has a husband, she is not.
