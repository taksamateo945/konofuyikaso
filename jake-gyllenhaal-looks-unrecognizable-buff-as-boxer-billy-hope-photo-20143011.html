In the first photo released by the studio, the actor’s seriously pumped-up muscles are on full display as he clenches his fists in the boxing ring to portray the championship prize fighter.</p><p>“Jake is going to change how people see him,” director <strong>Antoine Fuqua</strong> said in a recent interview with <a href=#>Deadline</a>. “I had him training twice a day in the boxing ring, he did two-a-days seven days a week. I pretty much had him with me and my trainer every day. I took him to almost every fight. I had him train at <strong>Floyd Mayweather’</strong>s gym in Vegas and we watched Floyd’s fights, and the <strong>Manny Pacquiao</strong> fight. He trained in New York at Church Gym with real fighters. We literally turned him into a beast… I’m confident that this will change how people see Jake, as a leading man.”</p><p>The Brokeback Mountain star, who underwent a drastically different transformation for Nightcrawler&nbsp;— losing 25 pounds — dedicated so much time to the role that it affected his personal life. “Literally, I think he broke up with his girlfriend [model <strong>Alyssa Miller</strong>] because he was just in the gym every day,” Fuqua said of Gyllenhaal’s most recent ex. “He was training like a fighter. I had him sparring, really getting hit. I put him in situations where I wanted to see what he was made of. No one but fighters understand the sacrifice it takes to be a fighter.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Southpaw follows Gyllenhaal — and his 15-pounds of new muscle — as Billy “The Great” Hope, a lefty champ who loses everything in a personal tragedy and is forced to fight his way to redemption.</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: Do you prefer buff Jake?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaKGao5VitLq4y56loZmRoXqtu86kqmatnqeypLvGp6CzmZKhsm6u1J%2BdZpmjYq%2BwxMSrZJuhnKHGbrTOqZxmqJikwbB5kWlobWtgZn4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
