Both Ludacris and his wife shared intimate images from that special day.&nbsp;</p><p>The rapper, whose real name is Chris Bridges, celebrated the news by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">writing</a>, “The Movie “Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls” starring Chris Bridges coming soon… 😂😂😂😂Chance Oyali Bridges Born 7:57 am 7/28/21 🙏🏾.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn-eaieplh.nitrocdn.com/zyYzBWDBYppGxNhsyVQfSgGBtZcaPafC/assets/images/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0dcebc52496f6ae340422bebf87c4a63.Screenshot_2021-08-10-Eudoxie-Eh-dox-ee-Bridges-on-Instagram-Our-Chance-Oyali-Bridges-came-2-weeks-early-and-we-are-bles...-600x440.png><p>At the same time, Mbouguiengue-Bridges&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a>&nbsp;that the newborn ultimately got her name from the 35-year-old’s late grandmother, who passed away earlier this&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">year</a>. “Our Chance Oyali Bridges came 2 weeks early, and we are blessed to have another beautiful angel named after my late grandmother. ❤️🙏🏽 7/28/2021.”</p><p>The couple previously revealed they were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">expecting </a>their second child by sharing photos of Mbouguiengue-Bridges in a cut-out beige dress as she cradled her growing belly on May 14, her 35th birthday.</p><p>The following month, Ludacris opened up to People magazine about how his life is as a “girl dad.” He told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">publication </a>that despite all the “estrogen” in his house he wouldn’t have it any other way. “There’s a lot of estrogen around here! Luckily, I have 22 acres of land, so I’m able to step outside and clear my head every now and then,” he said. “Then when I come back in, I’m loving them and hugging them the same way as if I went out of town.”</p><p>He also disclosed how his role as a girl dad became more involved as he had more daughters.</p><p>“The more girls I had, the more I tried to be a protector,” he said. “I want to make sure that I prepare them for the world. I’m teaching them financial literacy. They’re learning piano around here. They’re learning ballet. They’re learning great manners, because as we all know, great manners can get you places money can’t. I just want them to have a variety of assets and a lot of confidence.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ye49xZmpoX6HCpa3Cq6CsZZGjsW60yKxksKGWmnq4scucpqadXam1prXRZqqem5%2BjsW6vx6KjnWWTna6vr8Rmq7CnXayyprfSZpyaqpyufA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
