However, Kyle sees it differently, saying fans would see Teddi differently if she returned for a second time around.</p><p>“Teddi is an incredible person and an incredible friend,” The “Halloween” star told outlet, <a href=# rel=noopener>Daily Mail Australia</a>. “I think she actually is an amazing housewife.”</p><p>“I think if she came back, she’d be more comfortable just being more herself and she’d be amazing,” Kyle continued. “I would give anything for that because I had so much fun with her on the show and I love being with her.”</p><p>Since being let go from <a href=#><strong>RHOBH</strong></a>, Teddi has launched a podcast with formerly fired, but <a href=#>newly announced returning</a>, <a href=#><strong>Real Housewives of Orange County</strong></a> star, <a href=#><strong>Tamra Judge</strong></a> called <a href=# rel=noopener>Two T’s in a Pod</a>. The two analyze pretty much all things Housewives as well as frequently host current and past Housewife cast members. Kyle admitted that having that unique perspective would only add to <a href=#><strong>RHOBH</strong></a>.</p><p>“It’s just so funny how she can analyze every single person, she’s so great at it. And it’s just so funny how we all turn to her to give us her input,” Kyle explained.</p><p>Speaking of adding former housewives to the Beverly Hills mix, <a href=#><strong>Real Housewives of Atlanta</strong></a> alum, <a href=#><strong>Cynthia Bailey</strong></a>, recently expressed her interest in joining <a href=#><strong>RHOBH</strong></a> since moving to the area after her <a href=#><strong>RHOA</strong></a> departure.</p><p>Speaking to<a href=# rel=noopener> Page Six</a> earlier this week, Cynthia explained, “’I know <a href=#><strong>Garcelle [Beauvais]</strong></a>, I actually know <strong><a href=#>Sheree [Zampino]</a>,</strong> who is one of the new “friends of” on the show,’ I know <a href=#><strong>[Lisa] Rinna</strong></a>, I know Kyle, I’ve worked with <a href=#><strong>Dorit [Kemsley]</strong></a>. I’ve never met<a href=#> <strong>Sutton [Stracke]</strong></a>.&nbsp;‘I feel like I know those ladies well enough that if it ever wanted to make sense, it can make sense.’</p><p>Apparently, it makes sense to Kyle too.</p><p>“That would be interesting,” she said. “Why not throw her in the mix!”</p><p>In other news, Kyle also addressed how she initially said no to joining <a href=#><strong>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</strong></a> as acting was her true passion and she was actually taking a break from the industry when producers approached her.</p><p>“I said no for a while, but then all of a sudden, I was like ‘ok, I guess I’m going to do this’. At that time, I was just a stay-at-home mom. I had put acting on the back burner while I was taking care of my kids so I just thought it was something I could do while I was hanging out with my kids at home,” Kyle recently told <a href=# rel=noopener>ELLE Australia</a> recently.</p><p>Kyle also made headlines earlier this year after<a href=#> making comments</a> that seemingly insinuated that season 12 would be her last, but we’re not so sure.</p><p>“That went everywhere, like an announcement. I said that obviously there will come a time where I’ll say, ‘it’s enough’ but I wasn’t saying I was walking away,” she explained. “I take it a day at time, after we wrap the season because it’s really draining and really overwhelming.”</p><p>Speaking of overwhelming, Kyle also teased the drama that’s about to unfold on <a href=#><strong>RHOBH</strong></a> claiming it gives her “anxiety.”</p><p>“There’s a lot more stuff coming up in the season, that’s going to be also very anxiety provoking,” Kyle told the outlet, most likely referring to her<a href=#> upcoming showdown</a> with her eldest sister, <a href=#><strong>Kathy Hilton</strong></a>, and costar Lisa Rinna.</p><p>“In the moment when I’m shooting the season, I didn’t think that, but now when I’m watching it, and everything’s unfolding, I’m like ‘oh, my gosh’ it just gives me anxiety.”</p><p>Get ready to watch it all go down as <a href=#><strong>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</strong></a> season 12 is currently airing Wednesday nights at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tooZRitKrCxGaYp7Gknbavs4ytpmagkauybsDEnZuiZZ%2BjerO0zpufaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
