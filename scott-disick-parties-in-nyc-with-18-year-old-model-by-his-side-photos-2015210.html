The party continued throughout the day and ended at 1 OAK Nightclub, where Snoop Dogg played his set.</p><p>A source tells Us that Disick is pals with Snoop, and was behind the booth with the rapper, who goes by DJ Snoopadelic when he spins. The insider tells Us that Disick wasn’t drinking booze at the club, and that things were generally “low-key” at 1 OAK.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>After his club stop, he and Vrckovnik hit an afterparty at Soho House, which didn’t wind down until 6 a.m.</p><p>As reported by Us Weekly last month, Disick hooked up with Kourtney’s longtime friend <strong>Kimberly Stewart</strong> — but ended the fling once word got out. “He was trying to get Kourtney back,” a source told Us at the time. “But he is hoping she doesn’t find out.
