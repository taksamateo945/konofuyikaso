The Orange is The New Black alum released a statement on Tuesday in which she revealed she would be leaving her role as Kate Kane, Batwoman, on the CW superhero drama following its first season.</p><p>The series is now without a leading lady. According to Entertainment Tonight, Rose’s sudden exit leaves the studio a bit of time to find a new lead actress for their series, which will come back to the air next year in 2021.</p><p>In her statement, Rose claimed she made the “very difficult decision” to no longer star as Batwoman. She went on to express gratitude and respect for all those she worked with over the last couple of years, including the cast and crew, producers, and writers.</p><p>Warner Brothers’ Television, The CW, as well as Berlanti Productions also thanked Ruby in their statement. Reportedly, Batwoman was the first primetime comic book TV drama to feature a lesbian superhero as the leading character.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CAQ-jKNJ25I/</p><p>When it was first revealed in August 2018, fans and critics lauded the series for being the first of its kind. Just a few months later, she appeared as Batwoman as part of CW’s annual Arrowverse event in December 2018.</p><p>At the time of her casting, Rose explained to Entertainment Tonight that she was thrilled to be the first lesbian woman to be cast in a primetime television superhero drama. When the show was finally aired, it was hailed by the media, although, users on IMDb had an entirely different opinion.</p><p>Currently, the show has just a 3.5/10 rating on the Internet Movie Database, with many users criticizing the series for the supposedly incessant inclusion of identity politics. People on the popular website have described it as “lazy,” “boring,” “propaganda,” and were viciously critical of its purported political undertones.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>As one person put it, “the storyline felt rushed and the character seems to be a walking lesbian stereotype from the 80s.” Regardless of fan reaction, Ruby has appeared in several different television series and movies over the last decade, including Orange Is the New Black and Resident Evil.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeiqq%2B6edGoqp5lo6q%2Fsb7IrJysZZaWu7R5xK%2Bcq7GnnbKzsYysn56rXaGyosLIp55mrJiaeqTD0maZmqynpLqiuoyana2domJ%2Bbr%2FEmqqopl1ohnmEkGlm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
