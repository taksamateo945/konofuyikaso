Teaming up with her costume designer from her hit ABC drama, the actress has officially begun the countdown to the launch of her new line, which will appear in The Limited stores on September 23.</p><p>Lyn Paulo, Scandal’s fashion designer, says of the experience that it was amazing. “We really didn’t have any challenges with this collection. The whole adventure has been fun, exciting and honestly just a joy. The woman who will wear this collection is polished and sophisticated – a professional with an accomplished sense of style,” she says of the line.</p><p>“I truly admire Lyn and love collaborating with her to create Olivia Pope’s looks each week. Being able to work with her on a project that brings Olivia’s style and confidence to Gladiators everywhere was something I couldn’t turn down. The hardest part was how busy Lyn, Elliot, and I are. Our schedules, combined with our geography, made for an exciting collaborative process. With the help of technology and overnight deliveries, we are able to make it happen,” says Washington of her desire to help create the line Scandal fans all over the country are dying to snap up as soon as its goes on sale. Both the designer and the actress are excited to see the line on everyday women when it finally hits stores.</p><p>“Olivia is too busy to follow trends and looks for key pieces to incorporate into her wardrobe – look at her amazing outwear collection! It’s important to have a statement coat that carries across seasons,” says Washington of the most important pieces of her new fashion line.</p><p>(Photo by Alberto E.
