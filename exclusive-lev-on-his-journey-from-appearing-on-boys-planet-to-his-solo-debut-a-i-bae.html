Can you tell us about the inspiration behind the album’s title and its significance to you?</strong></p><p>My debut album “A.I.BAE” is an opportunity for me to grow into an artist from a trainee. I wish this album serves as a gift to my fans who have always supported me. I have high expectations for many new experiences I’ll have through this album.</p><p><strong>“A.I.BAE” introduces your musicality to the world. Are there any specific messages or emotions you aimed to convey through the album that you hope your listeners will understand and relate to?</strong></p><p>I believe I learned a way to express my emotions in my own way from this album and precious stage experiences. I hope all the listeners can also feel that I’m expressing my music in my own way.</p><p><strong>Looking back on the entire process of bringing “A.I.BAE” to life, what’s your favourite part of the creative process?</strong></p><p>The most exciting part for me is learning new things that I’ve never known while working on the album. With that, I was able to get a confirmation that I am improving little by little. It was a very rewarding experience to see my improvements, even small, every day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot_20231104_151744_Drive-683x1024.jpg><p><strong>Looking back on the journey from your appearance on BOYS PLANET to the release of “A.I.BAE,” what have been the most valuable lessons you’ve learned about connecting with a global audience and making a lasting impact in the music industry?</strong></p><p>I thought it was important to keep a vivid goal and direction within myself and not lose my centered focus. I realized that I can continuously improve if I keep the focus to myself, listen to others’ opinions, and be open to new lessons.</p><p><strong>If you could go back in time and tell your younger self anything. What would you say and why?</strong></p><p>I’d like to thank myself first for doing what I love to do without giving up even though there were challenges and regrets. I will never regret the decisions made by my past self.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot_20231104_151842_Drive-1024x677.jpg><p><strong>Looking ahead, what are your goals and aspirations for the next phase of your career following the release of your debut release?</strong></p><p>I hope to show better work by incorporating my experiences and lessons from my first album “A.I.BAE.” I wish to give back all the love and support from my fans by presenting good works in the future.</p><p><strong>Finally, what would you like to say to any of your listeners who may be reading?</strong></p><p>Thank you very much for supporting LE’V.
